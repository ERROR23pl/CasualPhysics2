# CasualPhysics2
Casual Physics 2 is a simple physics engine created to simulate newtonian mechanics: velocity, acceleration, forces and gravity.
It uses pygame as a base and most of the maths is done by myself. It means the engine is not really efficient but it wasn't made to be.

The project contains 3 files: CasualPhysics2.py, graph.py, tocp2.py.

graph.py - conatains Graph class, used in collision detection.

tocp2.py - is a script that contains simple CP2 language syntax to an actual python file.

CasualPhysics - contains every class used to generate Simulation.
